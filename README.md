# VBA-Challenge
VBA Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street

In this assignment, I created a mutli \-sheet code in an excel workbook. The code pulled data to show the yearly change in stock price, the percent of change from opening price to closing price within a year and the total stock volume. I also added code to highlight the positive yearly change in green and the negative yearly change in red. 

In addition, I am able to show the Greatest percent increase in a stock in one year, the greatest percent decrease in a stock in one year, and the largest total volume of a stock in one year. 

I also formatted my code to Bold and Center the text in my Summary Table. The columns also adjust in width to auto fit the values. 

The data pulled in this worksheet was too large for one screen shot, so please also see the full excel file to view the full data pull. 

My yearly results screen shots are saved in a Word Doc in this repository and the code is saved in a README file in this repository.
